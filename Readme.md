My Stuff from the 80'
---------------------
Things I have done with my Atari 8_Bit computer. Games, texts, pictures, type in listings etc.
Feel free to browse.

A good way to start is the [0_Collections](https://github.com/codingbychanche/MyAtari8BitSoftwareCollection/tree/master/0_Collections) folder which contains some examples.

Index
-----
- <b>ATRImageDirectorys	</b>
All directorys of all disks in this collection

- <b>AllAtrFiles</b>
A file list of all the disk- image files in this collection						
This file can be used as input for my 'atdump'- tool to create	a set of executable '*.xex' files. Works for most of the machine language files contained in this collection.

Above mentioned tool and mor (e.g. show and analyze the directory of a dos 2.x disk) can be found here:
